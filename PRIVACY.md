# Privacy Policy for QAchecklist.ai

Last updated: September 7, 2025

QAchecklist.ai (“the App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App processes, how it is used, and how it is safeguarded.  

## Information Processed
- The App accesses Jira issue content (such as issue summary and description) to generate quality-assurance checklists.  
- The App may process text that users choose to include in issues. This text may incidentally contain personal information, but the App does not require such data.  
- User account identifiers (such as Atlassian accountId and displayName) may be retrieved from Jira only for the purpose of attributing who generated a checklist.  

## Storage
- Generated checklists are stored in Atlassian’s [App Storage](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/storage/) service, which is hosted inside Atlassian’s cloud infrastructure and bound to the customer’s site.  
- No issue content, personal data, or checklists are stored on external servers controlled by the developer.  
- The App does not maintain any independent database outside of Atlassian’s platform.  

## Data Sharing
- For checklist generation, issue content (summary and description) is securely transmitted to the OpenAI API service. This is used only to produce the requested output.  
- No other third parties receive any data.  
- The developer does not sell, share, or use any personal data for marketing or profiling.  

## Retention
- Data is retained only in Atlassian App Storage for as long as the checklist is needed for the issue.  
- Users may clear stored checklists at any time from within the App interface.  

## Security
- The App relies on Atlassian’s security model and infrastructure.  
- All communication with Atlassian and OpenAI APIs uses HTTPS encryption.  

## User Control
- Users control what information is entered into Jira issues.  
- Users may remove generated checklists by using the “Clear saved checklist” function in the App.
